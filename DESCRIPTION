Description: Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is one of the important 
             post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms which occurs in 
             most human genes. InPAS facilitates the discovery of novel 
             APA sites from RNAseq data. It leverages cleanUpdTSeq to fine 
             tune identified APA sites.
